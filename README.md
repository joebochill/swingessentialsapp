# Swing Essentials® App (React-Native)
[Swing Essentials®](https://www.swingessentials.com) provides golfers with affordable, personalized video-based golf lessons. Golfers can submit short videos of their golf swing, and within 48-hours, they receive a personalized swing analysis video from a PGA-certified golf professional.

## Features

The lessons page shows a list of your past/pending swing analysis videos. Clicking on a lesson row will open up the analysis.

### Submit a Swing
To submit a request for a swing analysis, users must provide a video of their swing in the "Face-On" and "Down-the-Line" view. They may select a video file from the existing videos on their device or choose to record a new video live.

There are several settings available if the user wishes to record a new swing from the app. They may set the desired duration of the recording as well as a delay period to give them time to set up prior to the recording. They may also choose to view a graphical overlay over their video to show them how they should stand for each required view.

Video tips (delivered monthly) can also be viewed through the app. Likewise, the 19th Hole blog posts can also be viewed. Both are accessible from the main menu.
